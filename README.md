# hello-world
just a start to a hopefully life-long adventure.

Hi everyone!

This is my first project on GitHub.
The guide tells me to do a little self-introduction. So here it goes.

I am 27 years old and I am at a commercial bank doing clergy work. It's reaaly boring, so I am trying to learn to code.
Maybe I'll get to do this for a living, wish me luck, and thank you!
